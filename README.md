##ComputerCraft Scripts
A collection of scripts I've written while playing ComputerCraft in Feed The Beast (Minecraft)

###Scripts
####1. Smeltery Controller
This automates the process of using the Tinker's Construct Smeltery by:
* managing input from/output to storage tanks for molten liquids to minimize waste.
* offering a touchscreen interface to pour or drain the tank
* fully customizable for the casts and molten ores in the systems using the config file


####Notes
I may often use `button.lua` to create a touchscreen. This was originally written by [direwolf20](http://www.youtube.com/direwolf20), but I may occasionally make modifications to it depending on what I want to do.
